Need to source des18a
As of Oct 2020 need the following

export DESGW_DATA_DIR="data/"
export DESGW_DIR="./python/"
export PYTHONPATH="./python/:/data/des41.a/data/desgw/osgsetup/eeups/fnaleups/Linux64/lxml/v3.4.4/lib/python/:$PYTHONPATH"
umask 002
echo ''
echo ''
echo "Setting up Python environment..."
source /cvmfs/des.opensciencegrid.org/eeups/startupcachejob21i.sh
export EUPS_PATH=${EUPS_PATH}:/data/des41.a/data/desgw/osgsetup/eeups/fnaleups
setup --nolocks pyslalib
export PATH=/cvmfs/des.opensciencegrid.org/fnal/anaconda2/bin:$PATH
source activate des18a
unsetup numpy


Need files from:  /data/des60.a/data/annis/new_mi_desgw/Main-Injector4/python/work9
which is what is copied in this directory.


Just run:
source setup.sh
python com.py

In com.py
Set all to true the first time, then once they are done you donâ€™t need to remake the options 1 and 3 to make gifs


Resimulator.yaml is where you can change things
